# USER DEFINED VARIABLES FOR SHROOM'S ULTIMATE PROGRESSIVE STEALING SCRIPT
# This contains all your custom variables to run the Progressive Stealing Script 
# Makes it easy to update the steal script without having to update your variables 
# Simply update the .steal script, and leave this one alone and only change when needed. 
# THIS IS 100% MANDATORY! STEALING SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT THIS
# THIS MUST BE NAMED: stealVariables.inc - and in the same Scripts folder as your other scripts

# ALL OFF/ON VARIABLES MUST BE IN CAPS!

## SET YOUR CONTAINERS FOR STASHING STOLEN ITEMS (CHOOSE LARGE CONTAINERS)
